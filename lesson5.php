<?php
//Loops:
//We use loop to execute a block of command again and again as long as a certain condition is true

//In php we have the following loop types:
//while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
$count = 0;
//syntax
//while (condition){
//    code to execute
//}

while ($count < 10) {
    echo $count. '<br>';
    $count ++;
}










//do... while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loops as long as specified
//for - loops though a block of code a specified number of times
//foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
